## Introduction

JavaScript closures are a fundamental concept that every developer should
understand. They are powerful tools that allow functions to retain access to
variables in their outer scope even after that outer function has returned.

## What is a Closure?

In JavaScript, a closure is created when a function is defined within another
function, and the inner function references variables from the outer function.
The closure allows the inner function to access these variables even after the
outer function has finished executing.

```javascript
function outerFunction() {
  let outerVariable = 'I am from the outer scope'

  function innerFunction() {
    console.log(outerVariable)
  }

  return innerFunction
}

const myClosure = outerFunction()
myClosure() // Output: "I am from the outer scope"
```

In this example, `innerFunction` is a closure that captures the variable
`outerVariable` from its surrounding `outerFunction` scope.

## Use Cases for Closures

Closures are used in various scenarios, including:

- **Data Privacy**: Creating private variables that can't be accessed directly
  from outside the function.
- **Partial Application**: Fixing some arguments of a function and creating a
  new function with fewer arguments.
- **Event Handling**: Attaching event listeners that retain access to the
  variables in the function where they were defined.
